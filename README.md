# FRSKY_Tracker
Tracking and observing FRSKY telemetry data via Bluetooth
It allows the reception of telemetry data from FRSKY transmitters with Bluetooth, for example X20, Horus, etc.
It allows real-time tracking of an RC plane and the observation of telemetry data on an Android tablet.
The application has a home screen with several options.
1 .- Activate tracking on map (internet connection required)
2 .- Connect via Bluetooth to your transmitter
3.- Telemetry signal configuration. Initially, the signals are already pre-set by FRSKY, but these can be modified and others added.
4 .- Change font size, this allows viewing on a phone or tablet with a different font size.
5 .- This button initializes the Height reference for both the barometer and the GPS and GPS-Cumulative_distance.

When you press the tracking option, a map of the location where the screen is started appears. A blue dot will appear, representing the GPS position (airplane) and the position of the tablet or smartphone. The map is centered on the location of the Android device. This map can be rotated and zoomed. If you press the location indicator and drag it to another point, the map will be centered on that point. This allows you to better select the flight area within the map.
On this screen, the Bluetooth name that you have set for your transmitter appears. To set the name you want, you have to enter the transmitter and modify it in the Bluetooth settings. This appears as Local Name in the Bluetooth settings.
The GPS Lat and Long location, time provided by the GPS, and GPS speed are also displayed. The altitude can be given by either the GPS or the Barometer, if available.
